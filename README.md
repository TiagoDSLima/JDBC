# Studies on JDBC

This repository was created to document and share my studies related to the use of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). Here, I am gathering practical examples, theoretical concepts, and solved challenges with the goal of deepening my knowledge on how to connect Java applications to databases.

## Content

- Basic Concepts: Introduction to JDBC, drivers, and architecture.
- Environment Setup: How I configured my environment for JDBC development.

## Practical Examples

- Connection with MySQL database.
- Execution of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Use of Statement and PreparedStatement.
- Error Handling: How I am dealing with common JDBC exceptions.
- Challenges and Projects: Problems solved and mini-projects developed during my studies.

## Objective

The main objective of this repository is to consolidate my knowledge of JDBC and create a personal reference for future projects involving the integration of Java applications with databases. I also hope this material can be useful for other developers starting with this technology.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, it is important to ensure that the environment is properly set up:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A relational database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another of your choice).
- JDBC driver compatible with the database used.
- IDE for Java development (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.).
